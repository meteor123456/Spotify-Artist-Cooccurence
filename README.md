Data consists of a Spoitfy artist playlist co-occurence graph in the US. analysis.ipynb contains all the visualizations and analysis done on the graph. network_init.ipynb contains the initialization code for converting the raw csv data into a graphml file. The 30testvisualization.gephi file is a Gephi graph that shows a visualization of the graph using Gephi's modularity partition. 
1. Only analysis.ipynb is needed to be ran to see the analyis of the graph again.
2. The graphml files are all already generated in the graphs folder.
3. Only run network_init.ipynb to generate a new set of graphml files.
